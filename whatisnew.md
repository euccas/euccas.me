A few iOS apps that I worked on before are no longer being maintained, hence I added an icon here to mark them as "discontinued".

No updates.

Diego => Francisco. I have been in SF for two months (oh wow).


## 2018

### 2018-12-23
Last week: I found Ephic couldn't hunt new products, and the cause is product hunt's API sends back empty responses. I'm contacting product hunt and hope to bring Ephic back to work after fixing the API.

This week: It's the last week of 2018, and it's the time to plan for 2019 and welcome the new year!


## 2017

### 2017-09-17
Summer is almost over. I've finished two VR apps while taking the VR Developer courses on Udacity, and am working on a new one right now. Recently I'm traveling more often, go to new places and meet different people. Feeling inspired ;-)

### 2017-05-30
I've been back to San Diego in mid-May and resumed the projects I love. I'll publish a few new projects when summer ends. Stay tuned.

### 2017-03-20
The end of March. I'm traveling in China and having a reunion with my family and friends.

### 2017-02-16 
February is a beautiful month. I'm starting to build my first machine learning application. It will be a lot of fun. Will see what I can get in the next one or two months.

My quotes of the day:
"You got this. Make it happen."


## 2016

### 2016-12-18
New year is around the corner. In the last two months, I took a MongoDB University training course "MongoDB for Developers" and finished all the contents and exams. Right now my plan for 2017 includes learning Machine Learning, updating Ephic and creating one or two new Web Apps.

My quotes of the day:
"Do your passions wake you up every morning?"
